*IMPORTANT! If you are not of legal age to form a binding contract (in many places, this is 18 years old), then you must get your parent or guardian to read these terms and agree to them for you, before you use PixelBots or provide any information to us. Please review this agreement with your parent or guardian so that you both understand how PixelBots works and what restrictions apply to your use of our websites and services. Remember, always get an adult's permission before going online.*



### TERMS OF SERVICE

#### Effective date: March 1, 2015
Thanks for using PixelBots! We're glad you're here, but there are some rules you need to agree to before you use our websites and services ("Services"). When we use the word "Services," we mean not only the pixelbots.io website, but also all the other websites, products, services and applications made available by PixelBots. If you have any questions, comments, or concerns regarding these Terms or the Services, please contact us at info@9dots.org, write us at 931 N Highland Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90038, or call us at +1 (323) 740-0445.

These Terms of Service (the "Terms") are a binding contract between you and PixelBots. ("PixelBots,"  "we" and "us"). You must agree and accept all of the Terms, or you don't have the right to use the Services. Your using the Services in any way means that you agree to all of these Terms, and these Terms will remain in effect while you use the Services.

These Terms include the provisions in this document, and in the PixelBots Privacy Policy.

Our Services are constantly changing, to keep up with the dynamic needs of learners everywhere - so, these Terms might need to change, too. If they do change, we will do our best to tell you in advance by placing a notification on the pixelbots.io website, or we might send you an email.

If you don't like the new Terms, you are free to reject them - unfortunately, that means you won't be able to use the Services anymore. If you use the Services in any way after a change to the Terms is effective, then please remember that means you agree to all of the Terms.

#### Privacy and COPPA

PixelBots takes the privacy of its users very seriously. For the entire current PixelBots Privacy Policy, please click [here](/privacy), but we've included some information below related to the Children's Online Privacy and Protection Act ("COPPA"), because we get a lot of questions about that:

COPPA requires that online service providers obtain parental consent before they collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13. Therefore, we only collect personal information through the Services from a child under 13 where that student's school, district, and/or teacher has agreed (via the terms described in the following paragraph) to obtain parental consent for that child to use the Services and disclose personal information to us, for the use and benefit of the learning environment. If you are a student under 13, please do not send any personal information about yourself to us if your school, district, and/or teacher has not obtained this prior consent from your parent or guardian, and please do not send any personal information other than what we request from you in connection with the Services. If we learn we have collected personal information from a student under 13 without parental consent being obtained by his or her school, district, and/or teacher, or if we learn a student under 13 has provided us personal information beyond what we request from him or her, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a student under 13 may have provided us personal information in violation of this paragraph, please contact us at info@9dots.org.

If you are a school, district, or teacher, you represent and warrant that you are solely responsible for complying with COPPA, meaning that you must obtain advance written consent from all parents or guardians whose children under 13 will be accessing the Services. You are responsible for understanding how any Publisher Software (defined and described below) that you install on behalf of yourself or other users may collect and use information of users of PixelBots' Services. When obtaining consent, you must provide parents and guardians with our Privacy Policy; you can find a sample permission slip [here](/permissionSlip). You must keep all consents on file and provide them to us if we request them. For more information on COPPA, please click here. If you are a teacher, you represent and warrant that you have permission and authorization from your school and/or district to use the Services as part of your curriculum, and for purposes of COPPA compliance, you represent and warrant that you are entering into these Terms on behalf of your school and/or district.

#### Using PixelBots

First, you have to sign up for an account, and select a password and user name ("PixelBots User ID"). You promise to provide us with accurate, complete, and updated registration information about yourself. You can't select for your PixelBots User ID a name that you don't have the rights to use or another person's name with the intent to impersonate that person. In certain situations, your PixelBots User ID may be selected for you by your school or district; the same rules apply to them when they select an PixelBots User ID for you. You may not transfer your account to anyone else without our prior written permission.

If you are a school, district, or teacher, PixelBots will generate an access code for you to use with each limited access group you administer (an "Access Code"). For example, if you wished to establish a closed group amongst yourself, as a teacher, and your 5th grade class, you would distribute the Access Code only to those members of your 5th grade class that you wanted to view what was going on within that group. Everyone to whom a group administrator distributes the Access Code to will be a member of that "Limited Access Group."

You represent and warrant that you are of legal age to form a binding contract (or if not, you've received your parent's or guardian's permission to use the Services and gotten your parent or guardian to agree to these Terms on your behalf, as we described earlier). If you're agreeing to these Terms on behalf of an organization or entity (for example, if you're an administrator agreeing to these Terms on behalf of your district), you represent and warrant that you are authorized to agree to these Terms on that organization or entity's behalf and bind them to these Terms.

You promise to only use the Services for your personal, internal, non-commercial, educational use, and only in a manner that complies with all laws that apply to you. If your use of the Services is prohibited by applicable laws, then you aren't authorized to use the Services. We can't and won't be responsible for you using the Services in a way that breaks the law.



#### Intellectual Property

Anything you post, upload, share, store, or otherwise provide through the Services is your "User Submission." We claim no intellectual property rights over your User Submissions. Your profile and materials uploaded remain yours. By placing your User Submissions in a public space, you agree to allow others to view, copy, and reuse your submissions.

PixelBots does not pre-screen User Submissions, but PixelBots and its designee have the right (but not the obligation) in their sole discretion to refuse or remove any User Submissions that is available via the Service.

You shall defend PixelBots against any claim, demand, suit or proceeding made or brought against PixelBots by a third-party alleging that Your User Submissions, or Your use of the Service in violation of this Agreement, infringes or misappropriates the intellectual property rights of a third-party or violates applicable law, and shall indemnify PixelBots for any damages finally awarded against, and for reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees incurred by, PixelBots in connection with any such claim, demand, suit or proceeding; provided, that PixelBots (a) promptly gives You written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (b) gives You sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that You may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases PixelBots of all liability); and (c) provides to You all reasonable assistance, at Your expense.



#### Responsibility and Liability

Any information or content publicly posted or privately transmitted through the Services is the sole responsibility of the person from whom such content originated, and you access all such information and content at your own risk, and we aren't liable for any errors or omissions in that information or content or for any damages or loss you might suffer in connection with it. The Services may contain, or direct you to websites containing, information you may find offensive or inappropriate; we can't control that, but please let us know if it happens and we'll try to remedy the situation.

We also can't guarantee the identity of any users with whom you interact in using the Services and are not responsible for which users gain access to the Services. But that doesn't mean we don't take security seriously; students are only permitted to access the Services within their Limited Access Groups, we require teachers, schools, and districts guard their Access Codes with the appropriate confidentiality. We enable teachers with moderation tools for monitoring content within Limited Access Groups, and student accounts are not enabled to "browse" groups to join (a student is only permitted to view and join a group he or she has been given an Access Code to).

You are responsible for all User Submissions you contribute, in any manner, to the Services, and you represent and warrant you have all rights necessary to do so, in the manner in which you contribute it. You will keep all your registration information accurate and current. You are responsible for all your activity in connection with the Services.

The Services may contain links or connections to third party websites or services that are not owned, operated, or controlled by PixelBots. When you access third party websites or use third party services (including, without limitation, your use of Publisher Software, defined below), you accept that there are risks in doing so, and that PixelBots is not responsible for such risks. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Services and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each third party website or service that you visit or utilize.

PixelBots has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, accuracy, privacy policies, or practices of or opinions expressed in any third party websites or by any third party that you interact with through the Services. In addition, PixelBots will not and cannot monitor, verify, censor or edit the content of any third party site or service (including without limitation the Publisher Software). By using the Services, you release and hold us harmless from any and all liability arising from your use of any third party website or service.

If there is a dispute between participants on this site, or between users and any third party, you agree that PixelBots is under no obligation to become involved. In the event that you have a dispute with one or more other users, you release PixelBots, its officers, employees, agents, and successors from claims, demands, and damages of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and/or our Services. If you are a California resident, you shall and hereby do waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor."



#### PixelBots Pricing

The basic PixelBots Services are free and always will be - that is, we don't charge for signing up for a basic, individual PixelBots account. However, we may offer certain premium products and services for a fee. This does not mean that if you're currently using one of the basic accounts described above, that we'll "reclassify" it as premium account in the future and start charging you to use it.

#### Discontinuing Use

You're free to do that at any time by emailing info@9dots.org and including your username in the subject line; please refer to our Privacy Policy, as well as the licenses above, to understand how we treat information you provide to us after you have stopped using our Services.

PixelBots is also free to terminate (or suspend access to) your use of the Services or your account, for any reason, including your breach of these Terms. PixelBots has the sole right to decide whether you are in violation of any of the restrictions set forth in these Terms.

Account termination may result in destruction of any content, information or User Submissions associated with your account, so keep that in mind before you decide to terminate your account. We will try to provide advance notice to you prior to our terminating your account so that you are able to retrieve any important documents you may have stored in your account (to the extent allowed by law and these Terms), but we may not do so if we determine it would be impractical, illegal, or would not be in the interest of someone's safety or security to do so.

If you have deleted your account by mistake, contact us immediately at info@9dots.org - we will try to help, but unfortunately, we can't promise that we can recover or restore anything.

Provisions that, by their nature, should survive termination of these Terms shall survive termination. By way of example, all of the following will survive termination: any obligation you have to pay us or indemnify us, any limitations on our liability, any terms regarding ownership or intellectual property rights, and terms regarding disputes between us.

2. #### Limitation of Liability

SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

3. #### Indemnity
You agree to indemnify and hold PixelBots, its affiliates, officers, agents, employees, contractors, and partners harmless for and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages (actual and consequential), losses, and expenses (including attorneys' fees) arising from or in any way related to any third party claims relating to (a) your use of the Services (including any actions taken by a third party using your account), and (b) your violation of these Terms. In the event of such a claim, suit, or action ("Claim"), we will provide notice of the Claim to the contact information we have for your account (provided that failure to deliver such notice shall not eliminate or reduce your indemnification obligations hereunder).

4. #### Assignment
You may not assign, delegate, or transfer these Terms or your rights or obligations hereunder, or your Services account, in any way (by operation of law or otherwise) without PixelBots's prior written consent. We may transfer, assign, or delegate these Terms and our rights and obligations without consent.

5. #### Choice of Law; Arbitration
These Terms are governed by and will be construed under the laws of the State of California, without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof. Any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of these Terms shall be finally settled in San Francisco County, California, in English, in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. ("JAMS") then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with the Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS. Judgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any court of competent jurisdiction. For all purposes of this Agreement, the parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the United States Federal Courts located in the Northern District of California.

6. #### Miscellaneous
You will be responsible for withholding, filing, and reporting all taxes, duties, and other governmental assessments associated with your activity in connection with the Services. The failure of either you or us to exercise, in any way, any right herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the minimum extent necessary, so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. You and PixelBots agree that these Terms are the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding between you and PixelBots, and that it supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements, communications, and other understandings relating to the subject matter of these Terms, and that all modifications to these Terms must be in a writing signed by both parties (except as otherwise provided herein). No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a result of these Terms and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind PixelBots in any respect whatsoever.
